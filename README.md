# Ansible role Keycloak with PostgreSQL

This role is designed to deploy Keycloak on a systemd managed system. The role will install Keycloak from an official downloaded Keycloak zip archive on the target system.

The Keycloak server will be configured as a systemd service named `keycloak`, running as a `keycloak` system user. The role will handle the creation of the system user and the service.

This role also handles some initial Keycloak server configuration. This includes configuring what ports to listen on, creating an initial admin user, set welcome theme and configuring the PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements
Before running this role following requirements have to be fulfilled:

* Java JDK (version 8 or higher) for example with [geerlingguy.java](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-java)
* Running PostgreSQL with a user and database for Keycloak for example with [geerlingguy.postgresql](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-postgresql)
* In most cases also a reverse proxy configured doing the following:
  * Add `X-Forwarded-For` header
  * proxying to the http or https endpoint (without certificate check) of Keycloak
